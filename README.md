# PowerPulse
Full-Stack CRUD Application

Running of the App:
1. Go to the backend folder and run `npm run dev`.
2. Then go to the frontend folder and run `npm start`.
3. And there goes your application and you can view it in browser.

## Inspiration
In this continuously progressing world, people are busy with their own schedules, and many times they forget to take care of their health and fitness.

Even the people with some of the disorders i.e., diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, etc., need to take care of themselves for a productive life to live. Ultimately, the inspiration behind a to-do list of Workouts lies in the desire to structure and optimize fitness routines, enhance motivation, track progress, customize workouts, and effectively manage time, all of which contribute to a healthier and more fulfilling fitness journey.

## What it does
It is basically a CRUD application, where one can create, read, update and delete [CRUD] the workoutsüí™üèΩ.

A to-do list allows individuals to track their progress over time. By reviewing completed workouts, they can see their achievements, identify areas for improvement, and adjust their future plans accordingly. Tracking progress provides a visual representation of one's enthusiasm and helps individuals stay influenced throughout their fitness journey.

This adaptable tool allows users to customize the Exercise title, load, and repetitions (reps), as well as edit and delete them. When you add a workout, it even displays the time.
This adaptability enables you to tailor your workouts to changing needs or conditions. It helps you focus on what you want to accomplish, whether it's gaining strength, endurance, or accomplishing a weight loss goal.

Writing down your workout plan creates a sense of accountability. It serves as a reminder of your commitment to exercise and encourages you to follow through with your planned workouts. By creating a to-do list, you will have a clear view of your workout schedule. It helps you to stay organized and know what exercises to perform on a particular day.

## How I built it
I built this tool with the help of languages like Node.js and Express.js for backend server and React for frontend. I built this tool with the help of VSCode as my editor and Postman as an API Testing tool.
And then, I did the styling of the Page with the help of CSS and the fonts used in it are taken from Google Fonts and for the icons, I used the Material Symbols and Icons which again are provided by Google Fonts. And this tool is compatible and responsive as I did the styling in such a manner that the content does not overflow.

## Challenges I ran into
I ran into several errors, as this was my first time making a Full-Stack Application.

I had some difficulties in the coding for the backend server.

The most difficult issue for me was to adjust the tool so that when you add a new workout without refreshing the website, you should see the added workout on your screen, which I eventually did.... phew...!

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am very proud of myself for creating this tool for the betterment of one's life, as I always wanted to contribute some magical tools that could be helpful to the community and the people associated with it.

Above all, I'm proud of myself for developing a full-stack web application that benefits the people around us.

## What I learned
I had no idea of how to call the APIs, how to connect the backend server with the API Testing tool, i.e., Postman, and last but not least, how to modify the app so one can add and even delete any of the to-dos.

## What's next for PowerPulse
I'll give it my all to come up with new features because viewing the same UI over and over can grow boring.

So, the next steps for PowerPulse are:

1.  Making an authentication page for the users so that they can easily access the data from each date, 
 and making themselves proud of how much they have accomplished so far.
2.  Keeping track of the records of every exercise so that when they achieve new ones, the app will celebrate it with confetti and add avatars of their own, which can be customizable.
3.  Connect Spotify to my web app by calling the API's using axios library of JavaScript so that when they do a specific task, they can even enjoy a bit by listening to their own customizable playlist.
4.  Can share your to-do list with your friends.
